## 📝 Key Messages for FYP

### When Asked: "How does this work as an assistant?"

> "The dashboard is designed to be an active assistant, not a passive tool. When users log in, they're immediately greeted by the assistant with a personalized message. The assistant proactively prompts users to check in if they haven't, detects concerning patterns in their emotional state, and immediately offers help - whether that's chat support, personalized recommendations, or exercises. The assistant doesn't just show data - it actively reaches out and provides actionable support."

### When Asked: "Why would users engage?"

> "The assistant makes engagement easy and valuable. It clearly explains its purpose, proactively prompts for check-ins, and offers immediate help based on detected emotions. Each input method (text, voice, video) has a clear value proposition - users understand why they'd use each one. Most importantly, after detecting emotions, the assistant doesn't just show results - it immediately intervenes with personalized support, making the value of engagement clear."
