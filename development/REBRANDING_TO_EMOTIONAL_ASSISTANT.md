# 🔄 Rebranding: From Journal to Emotional Assistant

## 🎯 Project Goal
**Emotion-Aware Mental Health Assistant** - Providing emotional support, NOT journaling

## ❌ Terms to Remove
- "Journal"
- "Journaling"
- "Journal Entry"
- "Log Mood" / "Mood Log"
- Any reference to "keeping a journal"

## ✅ Terms to Replace With
- "Check-In" / "Emotional Check-In"
- "Express Your Feelings" / "Share Your Emotions"
- "Mood Entry" → "Emotional Check-In"
- "Mood History" → "Check-In History" / "Emotional History"
- "Log Your Mood" → "How Are You Feeling?" / "Express Yourself"
- "Journal Entry" → "Check-In" / "Emotional Record"

## 🔄 Key Changes Needed

### Navigation & Routes
- `/journal` → `/check-ins` or `/history`
- `/journal/new` → `/check-in` or `/express`
- "Mood History" → "Check-In History" / "Emotional History"

### Dashboard
- Remove "Journal" from quick actions
- Replace with: "Express Yourself" / "Check-In"
- Make all methods equal (Text, Voice, Video - no hierarchy)

### Page Titles
- Remove duplicate headings
- Header shows title, page shouldn't repeat it

### Loading States
- Better loading UI
- Smooth transitions

## 📝 Important Notes
- We provide **emotional support**, not therapy
- We are **NOT a replacement** for professional therapists/psychiatrists
- Focus on **assistance** and **intervention**
- All input methods are **equal** - user's choice
